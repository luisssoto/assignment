# MyApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.

## Main Requirements
- The goal is for the app to be able to add items to a list when enter is pressed and remove items from the list when the ‘x’ is pressed. When enter is pressed to add a todo list item, the input field should then be emptied.

- Should add a prominent title to the top

- Each todo list item should have a bullet point

- Should make some stylistic edits to the css file using their creativity.

- Should add two buttons to the top of the page (in any way they feel is best); one to sort in alphabetical order and the other to sort in order of date/time created (hint: sort in order of ID)

- Should document the app and provide a README on how it should be used.  You can safely assume we have NODE.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
